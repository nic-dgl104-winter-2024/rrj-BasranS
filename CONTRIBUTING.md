### Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

This Contributor Covenant sets out the rules for how everyone in our community should behave. We promise to make the community a welcoming and respectful place for everyone, no matter who they are. Good behavior includes being understanding, respecting different opinions, and taking feedback well. Bad behavior includes things like bullying, using inappropriate language, or sharing someone's private information without their permission. Community leaders will make sure these rules are followed and might give warnings or ban people who don't follow them. These rules apply everywhere in the community, and they're based on similar rules used by other groups. You can find more details and translations if needed.
