## Project - Storybook

### üìò About Storybook

[Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook?tab=readme-ov-file) is like a workshop for frontend developers where they can build, test, and showcase individual pieces of a website or app (called UI components) without needing to put them together in the entire project. It helps developers work on these pieces faster and more easily, making sure they look and behave as intended before putting them into the final project.

### ü§ù Contribution guidelines

Contributing to Storybook is welcomed and encouraged, with various avenues available for participation. Whether through proposing new features via the RFC process, submitting code for bug fixes and enhancements, integrating Storybook with new frameworks, improving documentation, providing examples, or developing addons, there are numerous ways to get involved. If you're unsure where to start, consider exploring existing issues and pull requests, joining community discussions, seeking guidance from project maintainers, and familiarizing with the project's guidelines is recommended. 


### ü§ù Step by Step Procedure to contribute

1. Node Version Management - Ensure you have a compatible Node version installed. Storybook specifies the Node version in the .nvmrc file. It's recommended to use fnm as the Node version manager and configure it with specific parameters using the fnm env command.

2. Running the Local Development Environment:
   * If using Windows, it's recommended to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
   * Run yarn start in the root directory to start a basic test Storybook "sandbox."
   * If encounter any errors, try rerunning yarn start a second time.

3. Handling Issues - If there is any specific issues, follow the provided instructions for resolving them, such as running specific commands to identify and potentially remove unintentional local changes.

4. Forked Repositories - If the repository is forked, disable GitHub Actions for repo to prevent potential failures due to lack of proper authorization.

5. Running against Different Sandbox Templates - One can choose a specific template to use for your sandbox to select the desired template and task.

6. Making Code Changes - If there is need to make code changes to Storybook packages while running a sandbox, follow the provided steps.

### Choosen Issue - [More clarity on what including compodoc does?](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/24944)

#### *Issue Tags*

* angular
* cli
* documentation
* good first issue
* help wanted

### üîç Detailed Explanation of Issue  

The problem described in the issue is related to the lack of clear documentation regarding the usage of Compodoc within a Command Line Interface (CLI). When users encounter this prompt within the CLI, asking if they want to use Compodoc, they express a need for more detailed information on what Compodoc does and how it integrates with the project workflow as, this is an angular project.

The provided links offer additional context by directing to a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77519750/using-compodoc-for-storybook-documentation) question discussing the utilization of Compodoc for Storybook documentation. This implies that the users seek clarity on how Compodoc can be utilized in conjunction with Storybook.

### ‚úÖ Work Done 

To contribute to an open-source project of community code part 1:

* I Forked and cloned the project to my machine.
* After that, I establish a new branch with name compodoc_info to work upon the issue.
* Did research about compodoc documentation for angular projects which provided as references.
* Then after, I create a file with name "compodoc_readme.md" and add everything relevant to the topic along with the forked repo and issue link.
* Then I commit and push all the content to GitHub.

### Code Review and Outcome

The documentation got reviewd by Baljit Singh, and he told me to add a section in my readme which describes some "Real-world examples" 
who uses compodoc documentation for the Angular projects which , I added now.

### Reflection on Success

Upon successful completion of this issue, I gained some useful knowledge regarding a completely new topic Although, this is a documentation issue but, this needs a lot of research as, this topic is completely new to me and requires time to work upon. Also, I learned the importance of clear documentation. This experience emphasized the significance of seeking clarification, and advocating for change to drive positive outcomes and enhance the user experience.
