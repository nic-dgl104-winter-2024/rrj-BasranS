#### *Issue Labels*

* angular
* CLI
* documentation
* good first issue
* help wanted

### üîç Detailed Explanation of Issue  

The problem described in the issue is related to the lack of clear documentation regarding the usage of Compodoc within a Command Line Interface (CLI). When users encounter this prompt within the CLI, asking if they want to use Compodoc, they express a need for more detailed information on what Compodoc does and how it integrates with the project workflow as, this is an angular project.

The provided links offer additional context by directing to a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77519750/using-compodoc-for-storybook-documentation) question discussing the utilization of Compodoc for Storybook documentation. This implies that the users seek clarity on how Compodoc can be utilized in conjunction with Storybook.

### ‚úÖ Work Done 

To contribute to an open-source project of community code part 1:

* I Forked and cloned the project to my machine.
* After that, I establish a new branch with name compodoc_info to work upon the issue.
* Did research about compodoc documentation for angular projects which provided as references.
* Then after, I create a file with name ["compodoc_readme.md"](https://github.com/BasranS/storybook/blob/compodoc_info/Compodoc_readme.md) and add everything relevant to the topic.
* Also, I made a contribution file under name ["compodoc_contribtuion.md"](https://github.com/BasranS/storybook/blob/compodoc_info/Compodoc_contribution.md) to describe my contribution for this work.
* Then I commit and push all the content to GitHub.

### Code Review and Outcome

The documentation got reviewed by Baljit Singh, and he told me to add a section in my readme which describes some "Real-world examples" 
who uses compodoc documentation for the Angular projects which , I added now.

### Reflection on Success

Upon successful completion of this issue, I gained some useful knowledge regarding a completely new topic Although, this is a documentation issue but, this needs a lot of research as, this topic is completely new to me and requires time to work upon. Also, I learned the importance of clear documentation. This experience emphasized the significance of seeking clarification, and advocating for change to drive positive outcomes and enhance the user experience.

### Next Steps

As I gain knowledge on this topic, my curiosity drives me to seek further understanding through additional research. Furthermore, I aim to put it into practice to observe its practical outcomes firsthand.

### Selected Issue 1 - [Add React Native Implementation for Singleton Pattern #8](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues/8)

### ‚ú® About selected Issue 1 

For this issue, I need to integrate the Singleton pattern into our React Native app. This pattern ensures that only one instance of a specific class exists in the entire application, which is beneficial for managing shared resources efficiently. By implementing the Singleton pattern, we can guarantee consistency and prevent resource wastage in our app.

### ‚ú® [New Pull Request](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/102*)

For new pull request, we decided to go with three different files named as ["Singleton_pattern.js"](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/102/files#diff-208f2b77c3d1f613176baed8f41459236850d5af18e85511b17c2496dede4058) which is for the react native code. Another one is a readme file under name ["Singleton_readme.md"](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/102/files#diff-81a32c10935e99a34d714d440765b96736e61833cef70ffb2fd45ae97e0e8754) to describe all about react-native for singleton pattern implementation. Lastly, we create a contribution file to describe our contributions for the outcome of this issue with name ["Singleton_contribution.md"](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/102/files#diff-54eb7ab7f0213e47979aa159587146d611beace7f8125ff48b1bdf02c3e49b3e)

Here is the final outcome in support of this issue

```javascript
// SingletonExample.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

class MySingleton {
  constructor() {
    if (MySingleton.instance) {
      return MySingleton.instance;
    }
    MySingleton.instance = this;

    // Initialize properties
    this.myProperty = "Initial Value";
  }

  // Instance method example
  myMethod() {
    console.log('Singleton method has been called.');
  }

  // Another instance method example
  anotherMethod() {
    console.log('Another method of the Singleton has been called.');
  }

  // Static method to get instance
  static getInstance() {
    if (!MySingleton.instance) {
      MySingleton.instance = new MySingleton();
    }
    return MySingleton.instance;
  }
}

class SingletonExample extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // Get the Singleton instance
    this.singletonInstance = MySingleton.getInstance();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Singleton Example Component</Text>
        <Text>Property value: {this.singletonInstance.myProperty}</Text>
        <Button
          title="Call Singleton Method"
          onPress={() => this.singletonInstance.myMethod()}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default SingletonExample;
```


### ‚ú® Code Review and Outcomes

Sumit Joshi did our code review for this issue. We met at college for the discussion on this issue. He suggest us to do some changes in the code. As, in my first pull request, I gave the react native code after the conse.log statement. He told me add it from the starting of the code to enhance its structure and clarity as well. 

Also, I got bunch of reviews from my last pull request regarding some changes suggested for the contribution.md file which is to remove anything not directly related to React Native for the singleton pattern, like the benefits section. Also, advised to properly formatting references in the README file according to MLA or APA style, and using hyperlinks where needed. Additionally, there is recommendations including a relevant example in the README, properly formatted with triple backticks.


### ‚ú® Reflection on success

Through implementing the Singleton pattern, I have learned how to ensure only one instance of a class exists in the React Native application. This experience has also taught you about effective code organization, instance management, event handling, and the reflection on design pattern choices for future projects.
