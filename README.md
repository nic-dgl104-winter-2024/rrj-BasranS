## Week 8 ( Feb. 26)

## Activity 1 - Read the Research and Reflection assignment

Make sure to visit the description of the Research & Reflection assignment on Brightspace. You should read the assignment description and the rubric in detail to familiarize yourself with expectations.

### Outcome

In this assignment, we have to write about what they do each week in their class. There is a need to include everything we learn and reflect on it. The goal is to show our progression and learnings. Also, we have to make sure to organize the writing well and include references when needed for better and informative journal. The rubric grades the Research and Reflection Journal based on how well the content is write and organize. It checks if the entries are detailed and reflective and include proper references. Also the journal should be easy to follow with supportive statements and correct citations. Created the github repo on time is also important. Scores range from "Needs improvement" to "Excellent" for each part, deciding the overall grade.

## Activity 2 - Research a new language (Lua)

This activity conducting research on either Processing, Haskell, or Lua and responding to the following questions.

* What is the language used for?
* Who uses the language?
* What are some useful resources?
* Why are these specific resources useful?

### Outcome

*About Lua*

Lua is a versatile and lightweight scripting language that's great for customizing things like games and software. It's powerful, fast, easy to use, and can be embedded into different applications. Lua is utilized by video game developers for scripting, embedded systems engineers for efficiency, and software developers for configuration and scripting. Some examples of companies using Lua are Adobe, World of Warcraft, Warframe, and CISCO systems. Lua has some excellent features which makes it perfect. It is a free, portable, fast, robust, and simple embeddable language [(Lua: About, n.d.)](https://www.lua.org/about.html).

### What is the language used for?

Lua is commonly used in video game and game engine development, network programming, and industrial applications. Some of the popular examples are:

* Games: Warframe, World of Warcraft
* Network programs: CISCO Systems, Nmap
* Industrial programs: Adobe Lightroom , MySQL Workbench.

### Who uses the language?

In video game development, Lua is a popular choice, known for enhancing performance and contributing to games like World of Warcraft and Warframe. It also plays a crucial role in network systems (CISCO Systems, Nmap), industrial programs (Adobe Lightroom, MySQL Workbench), and embedded programming, offering efficiency and seamless integration with various languages. Many companies rely on Lua, showcasing its broad applicability in different industries.

### What are some useful resources?

## Activity 3 -  Write a user story

Pick out an app that you use regularly and choose a feature to write a user story about. You may begin by writing a relatively general user story, but you should endeavour then to write a collection of more specific user stories for the same feature. Consider writing about different contexts, or different uses (i.e. users with different motivations). You can also try to write some acceptance criteria (i.e. a checklist of qualities or properties that should be present in the feature for it to be “accepted”).

### Outcome

For my app user story, I choose [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). It is a popular online video-sharing platform where users can upload, share, and view videos. It offers a diverse range of content, including music videos, tutorials, vlogs, and more. I use this app regularly for education and entertainment purpose.

* "As a user, I can watch videos on the platform."
* "As a user, I can search for specific videos using the search feature."
* "As a user, I can subscribe to channels I enjoy for regular updates."
* "As a user, I can like and comment on videos to engage with content creators."

Acceptance criteria for the last of these user stories may include:

* The video player should load smoothly and play videos without significant buffering delays.
* The search feature should provide accurate results based on the user's entered search query.
* The channel subscription feature should be straightforward and easily accessible.
* The "Like" button should be visible on the video player interface, and clicking it should increment the video likes.

## Activity 4 -  Choose a language for community code

The Community Code project requires that you spend time writing code in service of an open source community. The code you write need not necessarily be shared with that community, but you should write code with the community in mind. What code you write will be determined by course content, community needs, and your choice of programming language.

For this task you should spend time thinking about what language you might like to work with for the remainder of this course. I recommend that you consider using a language you are already familiar with and preferably one that is closely associated with mobile or web app development. This is also an opportunity to learn more about your chosen language, so think of it as a learning opportunity.

### Outcome

The language I selected for the community code project is Javascript. Although I do not have much experience in this language but as, I am learning Javascript as one of my courses this semester, I can work on it with the fundamental knowledge. It's a practical way for me to apply what I'm learning in class and get hands-on experience with JavaScript by working on this project.

## Activity 5 - Star Github topics repositories of interest

Explore github and give stars is a new practice, I have learnt to gain the knowledge regarding different open source communities and their latest trends. Also, give stars to the interesting topic will be useful for us in future to stay updated for potential learnings.

To complete this tasks, I visit to:

[GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)

[GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics)

[GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending)

[GitHub Collections](https://github.com/collections)

## Week 9 ( March. 5) 

## Activity 1 - Read the Community Code Assignment

Make sure to visit the description of the Community Code assignment on Brightspace. You should read the assignment description and the rubric in detail to familiarize yourself with expectations.

### Outcome

The assignment encourages practicing good coding by participating in two open-source communities and consists of two parts. Although contributing to both parts are mandatory but for code only one part can be involved. Also both the parts should be completed simultaneously, not sequentially. 

Part 1 - Contribute to a real open-source community by improving code documentation, answering questions, creating tutorials, translating code, or working on GitHub issues. Fork the project, make changes, and document your contributions.

Part 2 - Contribute to a pattern library for DGL 104 students, involving software design and architecture patterns. This includes creating a README, CONTRIBUTING.md, and managing contributions through pull requests and issues.

The rubric evaluates contributions in two parts: Part 1 for external open-source communities and Part 2 for an in-house pattern library. It covers documentation, code organization, user-facing activities, and commits, with a maximum score of 52 points. Overall scores range from "Excellent" to "Poor," reflecting engagement and contribution levels.

## Activity 2 - How to contribute to open source

The open source guide offers a thorough and easily understandable content, organized into distinct sections. Each section presents something new for me as, I do not have knowledge of  these since I previously had no familiarity with the topic. 

*Why to Contribute to open source?*

This part explains how anyone can help improve open source projects, not just by coding, but also by doing things like writing, designing, or organizing. It suggests finding a project you like, checking if it's open to new ideas, and then following some steps to suggest changes or improvements. It emphasizes that everyone's contribution is valuable, no matter their skills or experience, and encourages people to get involved.

*What it means to contribute*?

This part shows contributing to open source means helping out with software that anyone can use and modify for free. It's like joining a team to make something better, whether by fixing bugs, writing instructions, designing graphics, or just chatting with others.

*Orienting yourself to a new project!*

This section give knowledge about how joining a new open-source project is like joining a new group with its own leaders and members. Each project has documents explaining how to contribute and rules for behavior. People use tools like issue trackers and chat channels to work together. Understanding these basics helps you contribute effectively.

*Finding a project to contribute to!*

This section give information regarding open source contribution at distinct levels during the project. Also, there is a checklist for before starting of every project with range of resource for new projects work.

*How to submit a contribution?*

This part provides information that contributing to open source it is useful to communicate clearly, keep it short, and be patient. Also, by following guidelines when submitting your contribution and respect others decisions to acheive a meaningful contribution to open source projects.

*What happens after you submit your contribution?*

This section give knowledge that after submitting the contribution to an open-source project, four things can happen: no response, requested changes, rejection, or acceptance.
