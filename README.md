## Week 8 ( Feb. 26)

## Activity 1 - Research a new language (Processing, Haskell or Lua)

This activity conducting research on either Processing, Haskell, or Lua and responding to the following questions.

* What is the language used for?
* Who uses the language?
* What are some useful resources?
* Why are these specific resources useful?

### Outcome

*About Lua*

Lua is a versatile and lightweight scripting language that's great for customizing things like games and software. It's powerful, fast, easy to use, and can be embedded into different applications. Lua is utilized by video game developers for scripting, embedded systems engineers for efficiency, and software developers for configuration and scripting. Some examples of companies using Lua are Adobe, World of Warcraft, Warframe, and CISCO systems. Lua has some excellent features which makes it perfect. It is a free, portable, fast, robust, and simple embeddable language.

### What is the language used for?

Lua is commonly used in video game and game engine development, network programming, and industrial applications. Some of the popular examples are:

* Games: Warframe, World of Warcraft
* Network programs: CISCO Systems, Nmap
* Industrial programs: Adobe Lightroom , MySQL Workbench.

### Who uses the language?

In video game development, Lua is a popular choice, known for enhancing performance and contributing to games like World of Warcraft and Warframe. It also plays a crucial role in network systems (CISCO Systems, Nmap), industrial programs (Adobe Lightroom, MySQL Workbench), and embedded programming, offering efficiency and seamless integration with various languages. Many companies rely on Lua, showcasing its broad applicability in different industries.

### What are some useful resources?

* [Lua Programming Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
* [Careerkarma](https://careerkarma.com/blog/who-uses-lua/)
* [Lua Documentation](https://www.lua.org/docs.html)

### Why are these specific resources useful?

These sources offer complete and well-organized content to make learning Lua easy. The Lua Programming Wiki gives diverse insights, and CareerKarma is an excellent learning path for more information.

## Activity 2 -  Write a user story

Pick out an app that you use regularly and choose a feature to write a user story about. You may begin by writing a relatively general user story, but you should endeavour then to write a collection of more specific user stories for the same feature. Consider writing about different contexts, or different uses (i.e. users with different motivations). You can also try to write some acceptance criteria (i.e. a checklist of qualities or properties that should be present in the feature for it to be “accepted”).

### Outcome

For my app user story, I choose YouTube. It is a popular online video-sharing platform where users can upload, share, and view videos. It offers a diverse range of content, including music videos, tutorials, vlogs, and more. I use this app regularly for education and entertainment purpose.

* "As a user, I can watch videos on the platform."
* "As a user, I can search for specific videos using the search feature."
* "As a user, I can subscribe to channels I enjoy for regular updates."
* "As a user, I can like and comment on videos to engage with content creators."

Acceptance criteria for the last of these user stories may include:

* The video player should load smoothly and play videos without significant buffering delays.
* The search feature should provide accurate results based on the user's entered search query.
* The channel subscription feature should be straightforward and easily accessible.
* The "Like" button should be visible on the video player interface, and clicking it should increment the video likes.

## Activity 3 -  Choose a language for community code

The Community Code project requires that you spend time writing code in service of an open source community. The code you write need not necessarily be shared with that community, but you should write code with the community in mind. What code you write will be determined by course content, community needs, and your choice of programming language.

For this task you should spend time thinking about what language you might like to work with for the remainder of this course. I recommend that you consider using a language you are already familiar with and preferably one that is closely associated with mobile or web app development. This is also an opportunity to learn more about your chosen language, so think of it as a learning opportunity.

### Outcome

The language I selected for the community code project is Javascript. Although I do not have much experience in this language but as, I am learning Javascript as one of my courses this semester, I can work on it with the fundamental knowledge. It's a practical way for me to apply what I'm learning in class and get hands-on experience with JavaScript by working on this project.

## Activity 4 - Star Github topics repositories of interest

Explore github and give stars is a new practice, I have learnt to gain the knowledge regarding different open source communities and their latest trends. Also, give stars to the interesting topic will be useful for us in future to stay updated for potential learnings.

To complete this tasks, I visit to:

[GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)

[GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics)

[GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending)

[GitHub Collections](https://github.com/collections)
